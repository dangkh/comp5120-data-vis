Vibe-Eval consists of 269 visual understanding prompts,\\nincluding 100 of hard difficulty, complete with gold-standard responses\\nauthored by experts. Vibe-Eval is open-ended and challenging with dual\\nobjectives: (i) vibe checking multimodal chat models for day-to-day tasks and\\n(ii) rigorously testing and probing the capabilities of present frontier\\nmodels. Notably, our hard set contains >50% questions that all frontier models\\nanswer incorrectly. We explore the nuances of designing, evaluating, and\\nranking models on ultra challenging prompts. We also discuss trade-offs between\\nhuman and automatic evaluation, and show that automatic model evaluation using\\nReka Core roughly correlates to human judgment. We offer free API access for\\nthe purpose of lightweight evaluation and plan to conduct formal human\\nevaluations for public models that perform well on the Vibe-Eval's automatic\\nscores. We release the evaluation code and data, see\\nhttps://github.com/reka-ai/reka-vibe-eval\",\n",

       "  'summary': 'Existing VLMs can track in-the-wild 2D video objects while current generative\\nmodels provide powerful visual priors for synthesizing novel views for the\\nhighly under-constrained 2D-to-3D object lifting. Building upon this exciting\\nprogress, we present DreamScene4D, the first approach that can generate\\nthree-dimensional dynamic scenes of multiple objects from monocular in-the-wild\\nvideos with large object motion across occlusions and novel viewpoints. Our key\\ninsight is to design a \"decompose-then-recompose\" scheme to factorize both the\\nwhole video scene and each object\\'s 3D motion. We first decompose the video\\nscene by using open-vocabulary mask trackers and an adapted image diffusion\\nmodel to segment, track, and amodally complete the objects and background in\\nthe video. Each object track is mapped to a set of 3D Gaussians that deform and\\nmove in space and time. We also factorize the observed motion into multiple\\ncomponents to handle fast motion. The camera motion can be inferred by\\nre-rendering the background to match the video frames. For the object motion,\\nwe first model the object-centric deformation of the objects by leveraging\\nrendering losses and multi-view generative priors in an object-centric frame,\\nthen optimize object-centric to world-frame transformations by comparing the\\nrendered outputs against the perceived pixel and optical flow. Finally, we\\nrecompose the background and objects and optimize for relative object scales\\nusing monocular depth prediction guidance. We show extensive results on the\\nchallenging DAVIS, Kubric, and self-captured videos, detail some limitations,\\nand provide future directions. Besides 4D scene generation, our results show\\nthat DreamScene4D enables accurate 2D point motion tracking by projecting the\\ninferred 3D trajectories to 2D, while never explicitly trained to do so.',\n",
